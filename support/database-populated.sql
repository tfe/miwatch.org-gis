With scatter-site studio and one-bedroom apartments for singles and couples in Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as scatter-site two bedroom apartments in the Bronx for parent(s) and one child, the Supported Housing Programs offer a level of supervision appropriate to the integration of the SPMI or MICA consumer into independent housing in the community.\n\nAll tenants receive case management services on an as-needed basis. Their apartments are visited three times per month, once by a Case Manager and twice by a trained Peer Specialist. Monthly meetings with tenants and Supported Housing staff provide socialization, conflict resolution skills and self-empowerment. The much-coveted "Tenant of the Month" award, accompanied by a gift, is a highlight of these meetings. Recreational activities, such as movies, restaurant trips, or cultural events, are decided by the tenants and provide enjoyable outings to places they might never otherwise experience.\n\nThe Supported Housing Programs are part of MHA''s comprehensive array of Adult Services. Consumers have access to Recovery Works, a day treatment program for MICA consumers; Harlem Bay Network, a weekday and evening psychosocial clubhouse; Open House, a Friday night recreational program; Fast Track to Employment, an award-winning, nationally recognized employment placement and support program for SPMI consumers; Another Way, which provides referral and advocacy services to consumers with mental illness; and Parent Resource Centers for consumers who need support and advocacy around children''s issues.\n\nEligible consumers must be ready to live in independent housing.

After approximately 18 months in transitional housing, consumers are assisted with placement into a level of more permanent housing commensurate with their needs.\n\nOn the ground floor of Recovery Works is a day treatment program, which addresses issues specific to SPMI and MICA treatment. Groups include Relapse Prevention, Mental Illness/Medication Awareness, Double Trouble, Parenting, Housing and Life Skills. Because men and women in recovery have gender-specific needs, we offer separate Anger Management and Survivors of Childhood Trauma groups for men and women. The day treatment program accepts referrals from outside providers.\n\nA psychiatrist and a nurse are on-site. Case Managers work with clients to assist them with benefits and housing, and to monitor program progress. Our Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist provides a wide range of services, including individual vocational counseling, stipended positions in the community, and referrals to VESID and Fast Track to Employment, MHA''s employment and support program for SPMI consumers.\n\nRecovery Works consumers are involved in the operation of the program and work with staff to establish skill-building activities in the area of relapse prevention, mental health treatment, education, socialization, healthy living and employment training and support.
